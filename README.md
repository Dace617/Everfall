# Everfall

Welcome to Everfall, enjoy your time playing.


---


# Preamble

Everfall was initially created as a passion project to share with people what I enjoy about the game Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.
The list aims to improve upon the base given in the game already and fix a number of bugs and issues I, personally, have when playing Dragon's Dogma. You won't find sweeping world changes, or overpowered cheat mods that trivialize many of the games mechanics. You should find a solid, lightly improved, and hopefully enjoyable experience playing Dragon's Dogma with quite a few quality of life and visually appealing mods that perhaps are confusing for you to package together yourself.

I do have larger plans for this modlist. In an ideal situation I would enjoy including some sprawling changes to the gameplay or enemies found in the world, sadly, the mods required to meet this vision don't exist. The ones that do don't quite fit my vision for this game. So I will endevour to improve this list over time and possibly even learn to mod the game myself so that I can finally deliver on my vision for the game.

For now I hope you enjoy what I've provided, even if it is rather simple and largely similar to the original game.

## Remarks and Thanks

This list wouldn't be possible without the work done by Halgari and the Wabbajack staff.

I would also like to thank Styyx for brainstorming with me for ideas on how to get this list to function.

The largest thank you goes out to ForgottenGlory, GravenImages and PulsefireEzreal. I wouldn't have the confidence nor community to release something like this without ForgottenGlory helping me along and giving me some pushes to actually discover what I can do. And I would like to thank GravenImages and PulsefireEzreal for giving me valuable feedback while creating this list.

And thank you to anyone who plays this list. My biggest goal is to spread the fun I had while playing Dragon's Dogma to other people who haven't experienced it yet, or who want to bring back the fun they've already had with the game.

# Requirements

A clean, unmodified installation of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. The game is relatively old, so should run on most systems quite well. Using the SweetFX or ENB profile included my PC running the following specs runs at a steady 60fps at 1080p:

* i5 6700k Intel CPU
* GTX 1070 Graphics card with 8gb VRAM
* 16 GB RAM
* Approx. 13GB Hard Drive space is required for the list *including* downloads.

I have been informed AMD Graphics card users can run into certain issues using ENB and the like. If you run into any of these issues please try disabling the ENB or SweetFX preset first. If you know any workarounds for AMD users, please let me know.

# Installation

### Steam Setup

In order to install Everfall, it is required that you have an unmodified installation of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen installed through Steam. Currently only the Steam version is supported, as the GoG version is outdated in comparison. 

In order to ensure you have an unmodified copy of the game installed, please use Steam's Verify function to restore your game files to their original state. You can find information on how to do this [HERE](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB).

If you would like to keep any modified game files, please back them up before you do this step.

---

Once installed Everfall uses a Mod Organizer plugin called RootBuilder to simulate the game files for Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen and should no longer interfere with your Steam installation ***WITH THE LARGE EXCEPTION OF SAVE FILES*** this is detailed later in the document [HERE](#a-note-on-existing-save-files)

---

### Wabbajack Preparations

This section will walk you through installing Wabbajack if you have already installed Wabbajack you can move onto the next step [HERE](#installing-the-list)


In order for your installation to go smoothly the following steps are recommended:

1. Create two empty folders: one named Wabbajack and the other named Everfall. (I recommend something simple like: `C:\Wabbajack` and `C:\Everfall` You can replace the drive letters with whatever letter required)
2. Ensure that these two folders are not within any of the following folders: your Dragon's Dogma install folder, any of your steam library folders, your Program Files folder, your Program Files (x86) folder, your Documents folder, your Downloads folder, or the Desktop. 
3. Additionally, ensure that these two folders are not contained within each other, for example do not do this: `C:\Wabbajack\Everfall`.
4. Ensure that both the Wabbajack and Everfall folders are completely empty. If they are not empty, make them empty.
5. Download the latest version of Wabbajack from the Wabbajack website: [Wabbajack](http://www.wabbajack.org/#/)
6. Place the Wabbajack.exe file you just downloaded into the folder you created earlier called Wabbajack. ***do not run the wabbajack.exe file from your downloads folder.*** This exe file is not an installer, it is a launcher.


## Installing the List

If you are updating your existing installation of Everfall, skip to the [Updating](#updating-everfall) section of this document.

It’s now time to begin the installation of the list. Follow these steps:

1. Run Wabbajack.exe. Please make sure the exe file is located in the Wabbajack folder you created in the previous step.
2. Click the `Browse Modlists` button on the right side of the Wabbajack main screen.
3. Make sure `Show Unofficial Lists` in the top right is checked, Then scroll the list until you find Everfall, alternatively you can change the 'Game' selection to Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen.
3. Click the download button on the gallery card. It will look like an arrow pointing down to a line, or a Play button if you've installed the list previously and there has been no update since your last install.
4. The image on screen should change to the Everfall logo. Now, the second and third fields need to be filled out.
5. Click the three dots in the second (middle) box. Navigate to the Everfall folder you created in the previous section and then select this folder in the window that appears. This middle box tells you where the list will be installed, including the copy of Mod Organizer 2 that you’ll need to use to launch the list.
6. The third (bottom) box will automatically populate using the folder you just selected. This third box tells you where all of the mods will be downloaded. If you have hard drive limitations, you may change this to another folder on another hard drive by clicking the three dots in this box and selecting a new folder.
7. Click the play/right arrow button to begin the installation.


| With Nexus Premium | Without Nexus Premium |
| :--- | :--- |
| 9. Wabbajack will ask you to login to Nexus and authorize your API key so it can download mods for you automatically. If this doesn’t happen, it isn’t a problem and means you’ve already set this up. | 9. Wabbajack will prompt you to click all the needed buttons to download the modlist. This list is extremely small so non premium installations should be quite fast.|
| 10. Wabbajack will now download and install all of the mods. This should be quite fast. | |

Once complete, Wabbajack will indicate it is done with a green box that says "Installation complete". You may exit Wabbajack after this appears.

If it does not complete successfully (a red box with "Installation failed"), consult the Common Issues section of this document, or visit the [ForgottenGlory's Modlists server](https://discord.gg/NdmGpGzqg8) for assistance. A Thread for this modlist should be in the General-Modding channel. 

## Post-Wabbajack Install

### Mod Organizer 2
Among other things, Wabbajack has installed a copy of Mod Organizer 2 for you. This copy of Mod Organizer 2 is specific to Everfall and will not affect any other modlists you have installed.

1. Inside your Everfall folder, locate and launch ModOrganizer.exe. If this is not inside the folder, your installation has failed and you need to consult the Common Issues section of this document.
2. Mod Organizer 2 will have a dark theme already selected for you. If it does not, something has gone wrong and you will need to start over at the Installing the List section of this document.
3. A dialogue may appear and ask if you want to associate Mod Organizer with .nxm links. Click Yes. If this dialogue does not appear, it is not an issue and means you’ve likely already done this.

### SweetFX and ENB
By default, Everfall contains a SweetFX preset [you can find it here](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/49), and two versions of the [Reforged 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/437) ENB preset. Please only enable **ONE** of these at a time.

To enable ENB:
* Scroll down in Mod Organizer until you see the section titled `ENB (DISABLE SWEETFX IF YOU USE THIS)` 
* In this section you will see three mods, the first is the `ENB (ENABLE ONLY THIS OR SWEETFX)` the next two are the two different versions of the Reforged 2 preset.
* Click the check box to the left of the ENB mod, so it displays a check mark. Then do the same for **ONE** of either Reforged 2 or Reforged 2 Lite
Reforged 2 Lite should be used if you would still like an ENB but using the Reforged 2 preset causes performance issues for you.

To Enable SweetFX:
* Scroll down in Mod Organizer until you see the section titled `SweetFX (DISABLE ENB IF YOU USE THIS)`
* In this section you will see a mod titled `Sweet FX (ENABLE ONLY THIS OR ENB)`, Click the box to the left of this to enable it.

Please only use either ENB or SweetFX, do not enable both. 

Support for other ENB or SweetFX presets is relatively simple. simply install the preset into Mod Organizer, place it into the SweetFX or ENB category, then place all the files and folders that came with your preset inside a folder called `root` inside the mod. I will provide basic support for this on Discord.

## Updating Everfall
If you are updating Everfall, the process is very similar to installing the list. Make sure you are using the latest version of Wabbajack (it should automatically update itself when you launch the program).


1. Run Wabbajack.exe.
2. Click the `Browse Modlists` button on the right side of the Wabbajack main screen.
3. Make sure `Show Unofficial Lists` in the top right is checked, Then scroll the list until you find Everfall, alternatively you can change the 'Game' selection to Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen.
3. Click the download button on the gallery card. It will look like an arrow pointing down to a line, If you see a play button here you already have the latest version.
4. The image on screen should change to the Everfall logo. Now, the second and third fields need to be filled out.
5. Click the three dots in the second (middle) box. Navigate to the Everfall folder you created in the previous section and then select this folder in the window that appears. This middle box tells you where the list will be installed, including the copy of Mod Organizer 2 that you’ll need to use to launch the list.
6. The third (bottom) box will automatically populate using the folder you just selected. This third box tells you where all of the mods will be downloaded. If you have hard drive limitations, you may change this to another folder on another hard drive by clicking the three dots in this box and selecting a new folder.
7. Click the play/right arrow button to begin the installation.
8. If you are prompted to overwrite, confirm that this is what you want to do by clicking the Confirm button.

## A note on existing save files

### ***PLEASE NOTE THAT SAVE FILES FOR THE GAME ARE _NOT_ SPECIFIC TO THIS MODLIST. IF YOU HAVE EXISTING SAVES FROM STEAM EITHER LOCALLY OR IN THE CLOUD THE MODLIST _WILL_ USE THEM.***

If you have any existing saves for the game, please, either back them up locally or disable steam cloud saves while playing the modlist.

Existing save files are potentially compatible with the modlist but no responsibility will be taken by me for any issues that might occur from using them.

***I Highly recommend starting a new save after backing up your existing save files before playing this list***

## Launching Everfall
To actually launch and then play Everfall, follow these steps:

1. Launch the copy of Mod Organizer 2 found inside your Everfall folder.
2. In the top-right corner of Mod Organizer, you’ll see a large dropdown menu. Drqagon's Dogma should be automatically selected. If it is not, select it.
3. Click the large Run button.
4. This is how Everfall should always be launched. You can create a shortcut to this selection on your desktop, if you wish, using the Shortcut button directly below the large Run button.

***AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE THAT SAVE FILES FOR THE GAME ARE _NOT_ SPECIFIC TO THIS MODLIST. IF YOU HAVE EXISTING SAVES FROM STEAM EITHER LOCALLY OR IN THE CLOUD THE MODLIST _WILL_ USE THEM.***

5. Upon starting the game I recommend adjusting the in game options by selecting Main Menu, then Options. In particular disabling Depth of Field and ensuring a 16:9 resolution should provide best results. I also recommend playing the game in Windowed Mode and using a borderless fullscreen application such as Borderless Gaming, however Fullscreen should work perfectly fine.

## Mods and Mod Organizer

Unlike other games you might be used to modding in Mod Organizer. Dragon's Dogma has unique ways of handling it's game data. The majority of the game files are modified through various `Arc` format archives, these need to be unpacked and repacked whenever a change is made, therefore: ***The majority of the mods listed in Mod Organizer will do nothing if disabled*** as they have been merged into final archives. The mods are included in Mod Organizer to give a visual representation of what has been added to the list and allow proper credit to be given to the mod authors. 

Please refer to modifying the list in the Gameplay document if you would like information on what you can and cannot change.

## Common Issues

* Ultrawide resolutions have had issues during testing with strange visual effects during cutscenes, I recommened a 16:9 resolution. If you have any details on how to fix this for Ultrawide please let me know.
* The game can have issues when using Alt+Tab to focus other windows. Using Windowed mode and an external borderless fullscreen application such as Borderless gaming can be a workaround to this, but otherwise please limit your Alt+Tab usage if you have issues.

### Bug Reporting

Please log any bug reports on Github [HERE](https://github.com/Dace617/Everfall/issues/new) please note this does require a github account. Alternatively you can contact me on Discord, however a Github issue will ensure the issues is addressed.
