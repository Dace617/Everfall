# Everfall Gameplay

Everfall is (currently) a very simple mod list. You won't find any crazy, sweeping, world changes like World Difficulty. Everfall is designed as a slight improvement on the base game. I will detail the majority of changes in this document, however brief some of them may be.

## The Visuals

The visual mods included in the list are largely overhauls to the Arisen's character model as well as a few simple upgrades to the game's UI.

* [LDKSuperDante's Cleaner Body Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/473) has been used to overhaul the Arisen's skin textures for both male and female characters.
* [Lukasborn13's Megahair and Beards](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/467) overhauls the hair and beards for the Arisen.
* [vj88's Custom GUI Textures and Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/97) overhauls the vast majority of UI features in the game.
* [weaktofire's Vignette Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/99) removes the vignette from the edges of the screen.
* [offline2007's Don't Blind Me](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/39) has been included, because I can't play without it.
* Last but certainly not least, [Kaldaien's Agnostic Dragon - Aspect Ratio Independence](https://github.com/Kaldaien/AgDrag/tree/agdrag_011) allows the game to appear nicely on modern resolutions.

I would like to include some general texture overhauls to the rest of the game in future. Currently the available options are largely unfinished, so I have decided not to include any of them currently until further testing can be done.

## The Gameplay

The general gameplay for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen remains largely unchanged.

* [Signette's Spell Mod Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/379) has been included to modify how many of the game's sorcery spells function
* Various tweaks to Magick Archer and Mystic Knights stats are based on [Th3 Space Pope's Mystic Knight and Magick Archer Alternate Stat Growth](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/95) mod. Which should help reduce the need to switch professions when leveling. This is an ongoing effort and I would appreciate feedback on the hybrid classes of the game.
* A slightly modified EXP Table based on [Vagrant0's Alternate EXP Table](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/334) is included to make the later levels a little slower to achieve.
* Carry capacity has been lightly increased across all weight classes. This should remove some tedium from weight management while still keeping it a factor.
* [LDKSuper Dante's A Fortress Besieged Quest Improved Boss Fight](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/683) changes up one of the more lackluster boss fights in the original game.

## The Armor and Weapons

Fashion is the true endgame as they say. I have included a few tweaks to various armour pieces in the game.

* Firstly, [Rivianbleidd's Easy Clothjng Inventory ID](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/79) adds a small blue glow to clothing items in the inventory screen, letting you tell them apart much easier.
* [Akalor's Black Retextures and More](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/5) darkens the colour of several pieces of armour in the game.
* [urielmanx7's Chainmail Long Sleeves](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/454) should be self explanatory.
* [ExtraOrder's Short Scale Vests](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/652) shortens a number of scale vests in the game to fit better with other pieces.
* [NewmanLim's Saving Grace Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/642) improves the textures on the Saving Grace greatsword.
* [kimwisp's Delta Guard Legbands Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/526) removes the legbands from the Delta Guard armour piece.
* and [kimwisp's Sleeveless Berserkin](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/525) is included.


## Other miscellaneous inclusions

A few other inclusions in the list edit small things like the title screen and music in the game, I will detail them here for completeness.

* [Sevenredreturns' Segmented Healthbar for Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/374) is included, this adds segments to the boss bars. 
* [Yamagyeto's End of Struggle (DDO Version)](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/423) alters the music when you are close to beating a boss to the Dragon's Dogma Online version of the song. 
* [Ryles1's Dark Arisen Title Screen Revival](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/713), and [ReaperBiohazard's Into Free Dragon's Dogma Title Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/609) round out the title screen changes to bring back the original Dragon's Dogma title music (Added purely because I like it) and changes up the movies you see playing on the title screen. 
* Lastly, [SnowyOmen's NO ESRB Loading Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/30) replaces the blinding white ESRB logo with a much nicer Dragon's Dogma logo screen when starting the game.


## Editing the list

Largely, Wabbajack lists are framed as complete experiences. They are designed as they are to give a specific experience to the person playing them, and altering them can be both difficult and time consuming.

With the large exception of the Armour changes, and the Titlescreen/music replacements in this list: Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is annoying to mod. Any change that occurs in the game's archives requires that archive to be first, unpacked, then rebuilt after you have made changes inside it. For that sole reason, I have to highly recommend you don't modify this list outside of perhaps adding/removing some properly formated armour or weapon texture changes (which I may provide information how to do to fit this list at a later date).

If you do decide to modify this list, you do so at your own risk, I will only provide minimal support for altering the list as I have outlined above, there are many other places you can learn how to merge mods for this game.
